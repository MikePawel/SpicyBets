## How its made
Gated access:
1. Token Gated access: By fetching data from the Chilliz API a list of tokens can be displayed that give the holder access to the unique fan token page. The forwarding process changes the URL but also entails a security mechanism that checks for the availability of that specific fan token again.
2. WolrdID verification: A server based orb approach was chosen for the verification process.  Only users above the age of 18 can verify their iris via the orb, which would align with the betting property of this betting platform. Further, another security aspect was added to this backend approach. A timestamping mechanism was introduced that is verified in the backend to prevent replay attacks from happening.

Interaction opportunities:
1. Betting on future football games
2. Flipping a coin to win additional money
3. Tree-planting-donation interface

Seamless interaction:
1. Placing multiple bets offloads the burden to verify every single betting interaction.
2. Backend paymaster: A paymaster was implemented to pay for the random number oracle generator with gasless fees.

Donations:
Self designed Nouns were produced to match the intention of planting trees. A smart contract will be paid that is directly linked to funding the tree planting process.
